    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jolines Contreras but my friends call me Joli. I am 18
      years old and I live in Brooklyn, NY. I was born in a hospital in Queens.
      My family is from the Dominican Republic and my first language was Spanish.
      I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in June 2015 and will
      attend The City College of New York in September 2015,
      majoring in Computer Science. I'm introverted and usually keep to myself
      I warm up to people eventually. I love playing video games and reading. I
      want to hopefully one day work in the video game industry because I want
      work with what I love. I also want to study criminal justice or political
      science in college, and am considering attending law school after undergrad.</p>
